# Assignment: Week 9 - Personal Diary Management System
# Author: Zachary Derrick                    
# Date of latest revision:  5/31/2025   
# Purpose: Create a Python program that simulates a personal diary management system. The program will allow a user to 
#          record, read, and manage their daily diary entries. 
#          This exercise will test your understanding of file operations and exception handling in Python.
# Resources: A08 - File - Diary Document, OpenAI - helped in making rainbow text. 
#            I also use OpenAI for quick emoji reference and suggestions.
# Notes:   I wanted to make this colorful so I bounced ideas off of OpenAI on how to
#          best make a rainbow text thoughout the program.  This went though multiple
#          iterations before settling on the colorsys library, a first for me. I also
#          liked the idea of playing around with a password to protect the diary.  
#          This password is stored as plain text in the variable PASSWORD and thus not
#          encrypted. Also, I've used datetime in some of my security scripts before, 
#          so I wanted to have the option to have the date added automatically. 
#          Throughout the program I use 'utf-8' encoding to ensure characters are saved and read correctly, minimizing errors
#          An easy stretch goal would be to add user handling to this program. I was reading my last comment about
#          jokingly sending a message to the user and thought it would be nice to put the user's name there.

# This picks a color along the rainbow for each character by spreading out the hue evenly,
# converts it to RGB, then adds the colored character to the result string.
# At the end, it resets the colors before returning the full colored text.
