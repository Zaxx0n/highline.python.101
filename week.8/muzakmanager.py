# Assignment: Week 8 - The Music Playlist Manager
# Author: Zachary Derrick                    
# Date of latest revision:  5/25/2025   
# Purpose: create a simple music playlist manager using Python lists. 
#          add songs to a playlist, remove songs, view the playlist, 
#          and find out popular song choices
# Resources: A07 - Music Playlist Word Document, OpenAI - helped in making the loading previous playlist function. 
#            I also use OpenAI for quick emoji reference and suggestions.
# Notes: While playing around and researching the count() method, I found the collection module, which
#        is used especially for counting elements like the string names for our song titles.  
#        This program also saves a text file to the directory that the program is run from.  It also checks
#        text files in the directory for a header to recognize it as a playlist, skipping unreadable files.
#        A stretch goal for this would be to make a graphical interface, something I've only played around with.
#        Also, I'd probably add an option to seach through the playlist for a song being added and let the
#        user know if it already exists, but since part of the assignement is to count the most frequently added
#        song(s), I decided to not add this.
