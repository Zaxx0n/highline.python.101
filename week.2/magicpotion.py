# Assignment: Week 2 - Magic Potion Recipe
# Author: Zachary Derrick                    
# Date of latest revision:  4/13/2025   
# Purpose: Write a Python program that takes in user input for
#          a few pieces of data, calculates the needed amount of each ingredient,
#          and outputs a magic potion recipe.
# Resources: A02A - Magic Potion Recipe Word Document
#            ChatGPT helped create the menu system https://chatgpt.com/share/67fc4030-6ca8-800c-bed4-6c28e3b7350d 
#            Variables and Print Sample: https://youtu.be/03MGu250mqU?si=HHj-IILJ-xc-nsse
# Notes: I decided to go with a menu that allows the user to select from 
#        a list of cauldrons. An advanced version of this would allow the user to
#        input their own cauldron name and its size as an option.

# libraries
import math
import random

# main

# created some cauldron names and added some emoji for each 
# had help from ChatGPT creating this. I didn't want the emoji later, so I included a cleanName
